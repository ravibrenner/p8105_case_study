## Brainstorm questions

* Where are max and min airbnb prices?
  * what are average prices?
  * What factors affect prices? Location? Room type? Reviews?
* Where are prices going up and down over time?
* Relationship between # reviews and average review?
* Does room type affect availability?
* What's the location of different units?
  * What areas are popular?
  * Popularity = # of units? Avg price? Stays/month?
* Are there repeat hosts?
  *If so, what does that mean?
